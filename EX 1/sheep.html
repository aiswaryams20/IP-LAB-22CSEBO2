    <h1>Features of a Sheep</h1><hr>
    Sheep are domesticated mammals that are raised for various purposes, including meat, wool, and milk. Here are some key features of sheep:
<ul>
<li><b>Wool Production:</b></li>

        One of the primary features of sheep is their ability to produce wool, which is the soft and insulating fiber that covers their body.
        Different sheep breeds produce different types of wool with varying textures and qualities.
        <br><br>
        <li><b>Meat Production:</b></li>
Sheep are raised for meat consumption, and lamb and mutton are popular sources of protein in many cultures.
The taste and quality of the meat can vary depending on the breed and age of the sheep.
<br><br>
<li><b>Milk Production:</b></li>
Some sheep breeds are raised for milk production. Sheep's milk is used to make various dairy products, including cheese and yogurt.
Sheep milk is higher in fat and protein compared to cow's milk.

<br><br>
<li><b>Grazing Behavior:</b></li>
Sheep are herbivores and primarily graze on grass and other vegetation. Their unique digestive system allows them to efficiently extract nutrients from fibrous plant material.
<br><br>
<li><b>Social Animals:</b></li>
Sheep are social animals and often form close bonds within a flock. They tend to exhibit flocking behavior, staying close to one another for protection.
