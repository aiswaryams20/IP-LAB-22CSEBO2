    <h1>Features of a Camel</h1>

    <p>Camels are unique and adaptable animals with several distinctive features:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camelid Species:</strong> Camels belong to the Camelidae family, which includes two species: the dromedary camel with one hump, and the Bactrian camel with two humps.</li>
        <li><strong>Humps:</strong> One of the most recognizable features of camels is their humps. Dromedary camels have a single hump, while Bactrian camels have two. The humps store fat, not water as commonly believed.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Camels are well-adapted to harsh environments, including deserts. They can endure extreme temperatures and go for long periods without water.</li>
        <li><strong>Long Legs:</strong> Camels have long legs that help them walk efficiently in sandy deserts. Their padded feet also assist in walking on hot surfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Unique Walking Style:</strong> Camels move both legs on one side of their body at the same time, creating a swaying motion known as the "pacing gait."</li>
        <li><strong>Resilient to Dehydration:</strong> Camels can lose a significant amount of water from their bodies without experiencing dehydration. They can rehydrate quickly when water becomes available.</li>
    </ul>
